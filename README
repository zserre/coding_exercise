Question 1:

Implementation in Rakefile


Question 2:

Implementation in Rakefile


Answer to question 2:


Sensor 1: 4
Sensor 2: 10
Sensor 3: 18
Sensor 4: 99999999999999

Thoughts on question 2:

I would try and organize the data so it was cleaner there was some missing and incosistent pieces of data. Sensor 4
seems like it was an outlier so maybe something was wrong with the sensor potentially? I took the approach that if the name, value or timestamp was missing from each row I would discard the entire row, may be a little conservative but
will limit the amount of messy/noisy/errouneous data points. Also with this csv there were no headers so i needed to
look at the data bit and infer which cell of data meant.


Question 3:
